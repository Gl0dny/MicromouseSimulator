Projekt zakłada stworzenie symulacji robota typu micromouse, którego zadaniem jest przejście przez labirynt. Robot będzie wyposażony w czujniki, które pozwolą mu zbierać dane o otoczeniu, i na ich podstawie podejmować decyzje dotyczące ruchu. Symulacja będzie zawierała wizualizację ruchu robota w labiryncie.

2.  Funkcjonalność

    Generowanie i wyświetlanie labiryntu: Labirynt będzie generowany losowo lub wczytywany z pliku. Będzie wyświetlany w interfejsie użytkownika, pokazując zarówno ściany, jak i wolne przestrzenie.
    Symulacja ruchu robota: Robot będzie poruszał się po labiryncie, analizując dane z czujników i podejmując decyzje o kierunku ruchu. Ruch robota będzie wizualizowany na ekranie.
    Czujniki robota: Robot będzie wyposażony w czujniki odległości (na przód, lewo, prawo), które pozwolą mu ocenić odległość do najbliższej ściany w tych kierunkach.
    Algorytm nawigacji: Robot będzie używał prostych algorytmów nawigacji, takich jak śledzenie ściany, aby znaleźć wyjście z labiryntu. Algorytm będzie oparty na lokalnych danych z czujników.
    Interfejs użytkownika: Program będzie posiadał prosty graficzny interfejs użytkownika (GUI), umożliwiający uruchomienie symulacji, pauzowanie, resetowanie oraz modyfikowanie parametrów labiryntu i robota.
    Raportowanie postępów: Program będzie wyświetlał informacje o postępach robota, takie jak liczba kroków, odległość od celu, itp.

Sensor


Sensor Class

The Sensor class serves as a base class for various sensors used in a maze environment. It provides common functionality and data members that are shared among different sensor types.
Constructor and Destructor

    Constructor: Sensor(Maze* maze, const std::string& name)
        Initializes the sensor with a pointer to a Maze object and a name for identification.
        Sets up a unique Logger object specific to the sensor's name for logging purposes.
        Initializes directionNames, a map that associates direction vectors with their corresponding names (e.g., {{-1, 0}, "West"}).
        Enables file output for logging and clears any existing log files.

    Destructor: virtual ~Sensor()
        Ensures proper cleanup by disabling file output for logging when the sensor object is destroyed.

Virtual Function

    Virtual Function: virtual void getSensorData(int x, int y, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& knownMaze, int step) const = 0;
        A pure virtual function that must be implemented by derived sensor classes.
        Retrieves sensor data for a specific coordinate (x, y) in the maze and updates knownMaze, a 2D vector representing the maze's state.
        step parameter indicates the current step or iteration count during data retrieval.

Data Members

    Data Members:
        maze: Pointer to the Maze object that represents the maze environment.
        directionNames: A map that associates direction vectors (std::pair<int, int>) with human-readable direction names (std::string).
        logger: Unique pointer to a Logger object used for logging sensor activities.
        steps: Integer variable that counts the number of steps or iterations.

Summary

The Sensor class encapsulates common functionality and data members needed by various sensor types in a maze navigation or mapping scenario. It manages logging activities, maintains direction mappings, and ensures proper initialization and cleanup of resources. Derived sensor classes extend this base functionality by implementing the getSensorData method according to their specific sensor behavior.

This architecture supports modular and extensible sensor implementations, enabling efficient management and utilization of sensor data within the maze environment.




DistanceSensor Class

The DistanceSensor class represents a sensor used for detecting obstacles (walls) in orthogonal directions (North, South, East, West) from a specific coordinate (x, y) in a maze environment. It inherits from a base class Sensor.
Constructor

    Constructor: DistanceSensor(Maze* maze)
        Initializes the sensor with a pointer to a Maze object, which represents the environment where the sensor operates.

getSensorData Function

The getSensorData function retrieves sensor data for a given coordinate (x, y) in the maze and updates a 2D vector knownMaze to reflect the detection results.
Parameters

    x, y: Coordinates within the maze where the sensor is positioned.
    knownMaze: A 2D vector that maintains the current known state of the maze, where 0 indicates no wall and 1 indicates a wall.
    step: Current step number or iteration count.

Behavior

    Functionality:
        Initializes knownMaze[x][y] to 0, indicating no wall at the starting position (x, y).
        Iterates through predefined directions (North, South, East, West) to scan for walls:
            Calculates coordinates (nx, ny) in each direction relative to (x, y).
            Checks if (nx, ny) is within the bounds of knownMaze.
            If within bounds, checks if there is a wall (maze->isWall(nx, ny)):
                Updates knownMaze and logs a message indicating whether a wall was detected or not.
            If (nx, ny) is out of bounds, logs an appropriate message indicating the boundary breach.

Logging

    Logging:
        Utilizes a logger to log messages indicating:
            Detection of walls (Wall detected) or absence of walls (No wall detected) in each direction (North, South, East, West).
            Out-of-bounds conditions encountered during scanning in each direction.

Summary

The DistanceSensor class provides functionality to scan orthogonal directions from a starting position (x, y) within a maze. It uses a Maze object to query the environment and updates a 2D vector (knownMaze) to maintain a representation of the maze's layout based on sensor readings. The getSensorData function handles scanning for walls, logs detection results, and manages boundary conditions to ensure accurate mapping of the maze environment.

This setup is beneficial for applications requiring obstacle detection and spatial awareness within a maze-like environment, facilitating navigation or mapping tasks effectively.

            Logs the reset operation or an error message if the simulation is running.

Private Methods

    setRandomStartPosition()
        Sets a random starting position (startX, startY) for the micromouse within the maze:
            Uses a random number generator (std::random_device, std::mt19937, std::uniform_int_distribution) to select a corner of the maze.
            Updates micromouse's position and logs the micromouse's starting coordinates.

    hasReachedGoal()
        Checks if the micromouse has reached the maze exit:
            Retrieves the exit coordinates from maze using maze->readExit().
            Compares the micromouse's current position (micromouse->getPosX(), micromouse->getPosY()) with the exit coordinates.
            Returns true if the micromouse is at the exit, otherwise false.

    checkAndHandleWallCollision()
        Checks if the micromouse has collided with a wall:
            Retrieves the micromouse's current position (currentX, currentY).
            Uses maze->isWall(currentX, currentY) to check if the cell at (currentX, currentY) is a wall.
            Logs a collision message and terminates the simulation if a collision is detected (exit(0)).

Summary

The Simulator class orchestrates the simulation of a micromouse navigating through a maze. It interfaces with the Micromouse and Maze classes to control the micromouse's movement, manage simulation state, and handle logging of simulation events. This structured approach allows for clear separation of concerns and facilitates effective simulation management and monitoring.
